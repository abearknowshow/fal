# Image Editor Canvas Simplification

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed White Frame from EditorCanvas
- **File**: `src/components/editor/EditorCanvas.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed the white background container (`bg-white shadow-lg mx-auto my-8`)
  - Changed background to dark (`bg-gray-900`) for better contrast
  - Implemented `getImageBounds()` function to center image in viewport
  - Updated layer positioning to use image-relative coordinates
  - Made grid overlay more subtle with white lines on dark background
  - Improved zoom indicator styling

### 2. Updated Coordinate System
- **Mouse Events**: All mouse interactions now account for image bounds offset
- **Layer Positioning**: Layers are positioned relative to the centered image
- **Constraint Logic**: Layer movement is constrained to image bounds

### 3. Updated Crop Tool
- **File**: `src/components/editor/CropTool.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `getImageBounds()` function matching EditorCanvas
  - Updated mouse coordinate calculations to account for image offset
  - Repositioned crop overlay and selection area relative to image bounds
  - Improved crop info styling

### 4. Updated Extend Tool
- **File**: `src/components/editor/ExtendTool.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getImageBounds()` to match new coordinate system
  - Fixed mouse event handling for image-relative coordinates
  - Repositioned all visual overlays (extension areas, handles) relative to image bounds
  - Maintained existing extension logic and constraints

### 5. Improved Zoom Calculation
- **File**: `src/components/ImageEditor.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Reduced margin consideration from 64px to 32px for better space utilization
  - Updated `handleAddLayer` to center new layers within image bounds
  - Constrained new layer size to fit within image dimensions

### 6. Enhanced Layer Management
- **New Layer Positioning**: New imported layers are automatically centered within the image bounds
- **Size Constraints**: New layers are sized appropriately for the image dimensions
- **Movement Constraints**: Layer dragging is constrained to stay within image bounds

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UI**: No confusing white frame - users work directly on the image
2. **Better Space Utilization**: Image fills more of the available viewport
3. **Clearer Boundaries**: Tools and operations are clearly constrained to image area
4. **Improved UX**: More intuitive editing experience with direct image manipulation
5. **Consistent Coordinate System**: All tools use the same image-relative positioning

## Technical Details

- **Coordinate System**: All coordinates are relative to the image bounds (0,0 = top-left of image)
- **Zoom Handling**: Zoom affects both image size and tool overlay positioning
- **Responsive**: Image automatically centers in viewport regardless of size
- **Tool Compatibility**: All existing tools (crop, extend, layers) work with new system

The image editor now provides a cleaner, more focused editing experience where users interact directly with their image content rather than an abstract canvas.
